Here's a SQL query to find out if a certain genre had the most sales

SELECT F.name AS genre,
	   SUM(amount) AS total_amount
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN rental B ON a.rental_id = b.rental_id
INNER JOIN inventory C ON b.inventory_id = c.inventory_id
INNER JOIN film D ON c.film_id = d.film_id
INNER JOIN film_category E ON d.film_id = e.film_id
INNER JOIN category F ON e.category_id = f.category_id
GROUP BY(F.name)
ORDER BY(SUM(amount)) DESC

# SQL-Movie-Strategy
Identifying trends in movies sales to help a company launch a streaming service.

For a project on my **CareerFoundry** course I was tasked in pulling data across multiple databases in SQL in order to help *Rockbuster Stealth LLC* develop a key strategy to launch their streaming service.

Some key questions I wanted to answer were:
1. Which movies contributed to the highest/lowest revenue?
2. Were there differences in sales across geographic regions?
3. Who were our top customers and where were they located?
4. How long did customers rent videos on average?

After going through the data I used Tableau to create a visualization for my discoveries- [Rockbuster Strategy.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sean.carmean/viz/Task3_10-Rockbuster/Story1)

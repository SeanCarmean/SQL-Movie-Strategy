Here is a SQL query to find the top 5 customers by amount paid

SELECT A.customer_id,
	   B.first_name,
	   B.last_name,
	   D.City,
	   E.Country,
	   SUM(amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON b.address_id = c.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON c.city_id = d.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON d.country_id = e.country_ID
WHERE city IN('Aurora','Acua','Citrus Heights','Iwaki','Ambattur','Shanwei','So Leopoldo','Teboksary','Tianjin','Cianjur')
GROUP BY(A.customer_id,first_name,last_name,city,country)
ORDER BY(SUM(amount)) DESC
LIMIT 5


In addition, here's a SQL to go along with the one above to show the countries that have the top customers

SELECT D.country,
	   COUNT(a.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
	   COUNT(DISTINCT top_5_customers.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON a.address_id = b.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON b.city_id = c.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON c.country_id = d.country_id
LEFT JOIN
(SELECT A.customer_id,
	   B.first_name,
	   B.last_name,
	   D.City,
	   E.Country,
	   SUM(amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON b.address_id = c.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON c.city_id = d.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON d.country_id = e.country_ID
WHERE city IN('Aurora','Acua','Citrus Heights','Iwaki','Ambattur','Shanwei','So Leopoldo','Teboksary','Tianjin','Cianjur')
GROUP BY(A.customer_id,first_name,last_name,city,country)
ORDER BY(SUM(amount)) DESC
LIMIT 5) AS top_5_customers
ON d.country = top_5_customers.country
GROUP BY(D.country,top_5_customers.customer_id)
ORDER BY(all_customer_count) DESC

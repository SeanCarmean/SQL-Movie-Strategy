Here's a SQL query to see if certain genres were rented for a longer period of time

SELECT C.name AS genre,
	   AVG(rental_duration) AS avg_rental_duration
FROM film A
INNER JOIN film_category B ON a.film_id = b.film_id
INNER JOIN category C ON b.category_id = c.category_id
GROUP BY(c.name)
ORDER BY(AVG(rental_duration)) DESC
